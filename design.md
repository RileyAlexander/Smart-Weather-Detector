## Smart Device Theme

The concept of the automatic humanity detector is when you are detected that you are going outside it will see how wet it is out and through the different colours (Red, Yellow and  Green) it will say how wet it is Green being no rain, Red being it is poring and yellow being it's a bit damp outside. When you are going to go outside it will use sensors that will detect that you are going out. When it's too cold and wet you can press a button to make a coffee.


## Behaviours

1. To sense is if you are near the door about to leave it will use a line sensor and the sonar.
2. The moister detector will give the level of rain and that will tell the traffic lights what level of rain there is.
3. If the traffic light is red then a buzzer/Piezo will go off for 3 seconds to tell which means you should press the button.
4. When you press the button it will create coffee to keep you warm.
5. To make the coffee it will use a dc motor to stir the coffee and a servo to wave at you when it's done.
6. SD card logging can be used so you are able to say what type of coffee you would rather have.
